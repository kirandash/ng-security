# NgSecurity

## Angular Security

### 1. Installation and testing XSS attacks
Install node
Install angular cli: npm install -g @angular/cli@latest

Create project: ng new ng-security

ng serve

Angular bydefault saves us from XSS(Cross site Scripting attacks) for example, innerHTML or interpolation does treat the content as text and ingores scripts
